We need an accurate system to credit people, especially given that we will almost always be relying on "free use" content.

Given there's no solid way to differentiate assets individually (yet), each contributing development entity gets its own directory. This makes it easier for players (or job recruiters/etc) to find where a specific asset comes from, regardless of its implementation. As these assets are a part of a sandbox environment, we need to emphasize nearly complete usage, outside of direct monetization or claiming the content as our creation.
