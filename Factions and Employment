Player "occupations" are ordered from densest to lightest by developer intended population level. Actual population may vary of course, but I feel its important to encourage or discourage certain amounts of each job in order to have balanced gameplay.

A lot of the purpose that most of the jobs deride is from Science Team (R&D), and The Administrator. Here I will outline some of the interactions that may not have been discussed in the individual job descriptions.

In my experience, when it comes to non-imaginative roleplayers like me, the "gameplay loop" revolves around extracting reactions from skilled roleplayers.

This can usually be done with some creativity, but I eventually found myself doing this through violence. Plain and simple.
I observed (and witnessed) people harvesting/farming in Xen, and then selling them to create weapons in preparation for an upcoming server event.

I also got bored of farming, and spent most of my time grinding in order to teleport to Earth, in order to conduct guerilla warfare.
