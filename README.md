Realism vs gameplay convenience... that is the main objective of "Half-Reality: Black Mesa Roleplay" (MesaBox) so to speak. 

While the video form of Half-Reality is focused on balancing realism against cinematics, this medium is focused on balancing casual gameplay in conjunction with realistic roleplay elements. Hopefully, this allows players of all preferred playstyles to interact with each other without all of the contention and problems that have historically been observed in traditional roleplaying servers that have either hard-set or nearly unenforced rules.
