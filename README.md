# MesaBox

The intended selling point of this roleplay gamemode:

iWutta: "Chaotic roleplay concealed within a serious, realism oriented environment."

Realism vs gameplay convenience... I have often compared MesaBox to my other well-known project "Half-Reality", but the two are fundamentally different. 

While Half-Reality is focused on balancing realism against cinematics, this medium is instead focused on balancing casual gameplay in conjunction with realistic roleplay elements. The two projects are similar in this regard, in that they attempt to balance two traditionally opposing or conflicting aspects of their respective mediums.

Hopefully, this allows players of all preferred playstyles to interact with each other without all of the contention and problems that have historically been observed in traditional roleplaying servers that have either overly hard-set or nearly unenforced rules.

My aim is to have the least amount of server rules possible, and reasonably allow players to do whatever they want. In order to facilitate this, and not have the game mode immediately descend into chaos, I hope to implement plenty of positive and negative reinforcement in order to reasonably allow players to self-govern.
