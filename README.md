# MesaBox

The intended selling point of this roleplay gamemode:

iWutta: "Chaotic roleplay concealed within a serious, realism oriented environment."

We’ve had several visions for MesaBox. But we’ve all agreed that, at a minimum, it will be a platform to test new or risky RP concepts that other communities may not handle as well. One of the primary concepts we wish to implement is “realism vs gameplay convenience”.

Hopefully, this development mindset will allow players of all preferred playstyles to interact with each other without all of the contention and problems that have historically been observed in traditional roleplaying servers that have either overly hard-set or nearly unenforced rules.

Our aim for official servers is to have the least amount of server rules possible, and reasonably allow players to do whatever they want. In order to facilitate this, and not have everything immediately descend into chaos, we hope to implement plenty of code based positive and negative reinforcement in order to reasonably allow players to self-govern.
