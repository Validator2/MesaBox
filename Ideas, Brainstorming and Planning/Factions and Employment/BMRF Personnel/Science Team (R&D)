This should be the most populated job, for a variety of reasons.

1. This is how it is in irl research facilities.
2. This job encourages the most RP, which is essential to creating social dynamics. Social dynamics (making friends, making enemies) encourages players to keep coming back.
3. Every other occupation relies on this job to enable theirs. For instance, Security is useless if there are barely any scientists to protect. Xenians are useless if no one tries to capture them for experiments.
